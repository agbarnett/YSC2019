# YSC2019
R code for the workshop at the 2019 Young Statisticians Conference (YSC2019) in Canberra. Workshop title: "Maximising the use of Australian Bureau of Statistics Data Products and Analysis Tools".

Thanks to James Brown for the data and SAS code.

The code reads in the data and fits:
* Binomial model using the data without areas
* Poisson model using the data without areas
* Binomial model with a random intercept for SA4 (Generalised linear mixed model - GLMM) using an area-level data set

The data came from Table Builder at the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
